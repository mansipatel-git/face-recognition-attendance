# 🎯 Face Recognition Attendance System

### 🚀 AI-Powered Attendance System using Face Recognition

## 🚀 Project Description

**Face Recognition Attendance System** is an **AI and Computer Vision based attendance management system** built using **Python, OpenCV, FaceNet, Keras-FaceNet, and NumPy**.

The system automatically detects and recognizes students from a **group image** and records their attendance without requiring manual roll calls.

It uses **OpenCV Haar Cascade** for face detection and **FaceNet** to generate facial embeddings. These embeddings are compared with registered student embeddings using **Euclidean Distance** to identify the closest matching student.

Once a student is recognized, the system automatically records their **Name, Roll Number, Date, Time, Status, Confidence, Distance, and Recognition Method** in an attendance CSV file.

The project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Facial Embeddings, Image Processing, and Data Management** to solve a real-world problem.

# 🎥 Demo



## 1 Face Recognition

The system detects faces from the group image and compares them with the registered student faces.

## 2 Unknown Face Detection

If a detected face does not match any registered student within the recognition threshold, the system identifies the person as **Unknown**.
